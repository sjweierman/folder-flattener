**Version 0.5 is now available!**

This is a simple application with only one purpose: to flatten a folder containing other folders into a single folder. Suppose, for example, you have your Music folder "organized" into other folders by artist or album. When you copy your music to your mp3 player, you find you have a ton of folders, and some mp3 players don't like that. This application will automagically move all those files to the outermost folder, and delete the other folders.

It does a simple check for duplicates, and verifies if you want to overwrite files.

This was a quick-and-dirty weekend hack, so don't expect to see the prettiest code. :-P
